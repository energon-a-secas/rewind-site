// fleet is working on and what it has closed, which nobody reported and nobody
// outside would otherwise know. Keeping them apart is not tidiness: an entry
// under the wrong heading claims a stranger asked for it.
//
// Everything rendered here was typed by an operator. The Worker's /board query
// names no source text, no private ref and no site, so there is nothing on this
// surface to redact at render time. C5 still holds anyway: elem() and setText()
// only, no innerHTML.
//
// RESOLVED IS THE POINT. A board that only grows is a graveyard, so resolutions
// come first, the newest one is labelled and given the accent, and the open
// items sit under them. The ordering is the Worker's; this file does not sort.
