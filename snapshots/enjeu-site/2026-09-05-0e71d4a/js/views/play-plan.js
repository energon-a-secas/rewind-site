// ── The plan lane ────────────────────────────────────────────
// A turn is DECLARED and then played. The player clicks a card once per action
// they want it to take, the clicks become numbered steps in order, and one
// button walks the lane. Nothing here touches the DOM or the strings, so the
// tests drive the same code the board does (tests/play.test.mjs).
//
// Rulings this file makes where RULES.md is silent (the rulebook is the source
// of the rules and it does not know about a screen, so these are UI readings of
// section 5, kept as conservative as they can be):
//   - Declaring a turn changes nothing until it resolves. RULES section 5 costs
//     the bet when the attack is made, so a queued step stakes no card and a
//     dropped step gives nothing back: there is nothing to give back.
//   - A plan is checked when it is built AND again before every step, because
//     the fight moves while the lane resolves (a minion falls, a bet spends the
//     card a later step needed). An illegal plan STOPS at that step with its
//     reason; it never skips the step and carries on.
//   - Ready cards do not recover mid-turn (section 4 recovers them at the start
//     of a turn), so simulating the bets forward is exact, not an estimate.
//   - A Rune attached to a step is the rulebook's "declare it before rolling",
//     one step earlier: the Rune is played the moment it is attached, and the
//     engine spends it on that step's check.
