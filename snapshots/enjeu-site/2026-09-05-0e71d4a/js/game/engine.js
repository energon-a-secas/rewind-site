// ── Engine (contract C3) ─────────────────────────────────────
// Pure functions over a Fight object, no DOM, no randomness of its own:
// every roll comes in from outside (a human's die, or a seeded stream), so
// the play runner and the batch simulator share every line of rules.
//
// Source of truth for the rules: RULES.md. Source of the shape: tools/sim.py,
// ported function for function (take, affordable, p_kill, choose live in
// strategies.js). Where the rulebook says more than the Python models, the
// rulebook wins and the Python's simplification is kept behind `legacy` so
// its published table can still be reproduced and checked.
//
// legacy (sim.py parity) differs from the rulebook in exactly three places:
//   1. Brace never halves the boss's incoming damage (it only skips a hit).
//   2. Summon moves a flat 100 hp off the body (not 2 x the boss's per-card
//      value) and needs body > 100.
//   3. Roar flattens the NEXT attack's check to Even, Strike included.
// It used to differ in a fourth: the fight was won on the body alone. The
// rulebook agrees with it now (2026-08-30), so that row is gone rather than
// green by accident. legacy also skips break points and the Run penalty, both
// of which arrived after tools/sim.py was last a source of truth.
// Rulings this file made while RULES.md was silent. Most were promoted INTO the
// rulebook on 2026-08-28, so the list below is now a map of where each one is
// written down, not a list of things only the code knows:
//   - an attack's element is the card's, falling back to the hero's: RULES.md s6
//   - a minion's damage does not spill to the boss's body: RULES.md s7
//   - Knight's free guard does not apply under Rage: RULES.md s7
//   - which cards break first under Rage (Ready, then Spent): RULES.md s7
//   - leftover damage after the Ally's defense is lost: RULES.md s7
//   - a downgraded Summon is a Strike and can be aimed at the Ally: RULES.md s7
//   - tier-0 skills start in the pool: RULES.md s8
// STILL ONLY HERE, and each is a gap worth closing in the rulebook rather than
// leaving in a comment:
//   - Ally lasts the level; Relic lasts the level; Rune is one check
//   - a minion's 25 always comes for the hero, never the Ally
//   - the Ally's own free 25 always hits the body and can never be aimed at a
//     minion, which the minion-overkill rule now makes load-bearing
