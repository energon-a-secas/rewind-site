// One function, one SVG string, used by the card browser, the print sheet
// and the play runner. The grid is 630 x 880: ten units per millimetre of a
// 63 x 88 mm poker card, so print.css can size the SVG in millimetres and
// the paper gets exactly this.
//
// docs/CARD-LAYOUT.md is the spec. Four corners, pips and numerals only:
//   top-left     bet (pips)          top-right    check (pips)
//   bottom-left  tier (numeral)      bottom-right damage (numeral)
// Oval frame holds the glyph; a DOUBLED outer frame means 2 actions; a class
// glyph beside the tier means class-locked; the element sigil sits in the
// top-left quadrant under the bet pips. Life cards: coloured face, big 25,
// sigil. No body text on any card, and the name never appears: the player
// says it out loud.

/**
 * ── Colour, and where it is allowed to go ────────────────────
 *
 * The first pass put the card's only colour INSIDE the picture, by tinting the
 * glyph to the element. That is backwards twice over: a mid-tone icon on white
 * paper has less contrast than a black one (Gale's slate on white was nearly
 * gone), and it spends the element signal on the one element of the card that
 * should be carrying its own meaning. So colour moved outwards:
 *
 *   FIELD   a washed oval, the element at about a tenth strength. Large, quiet,
 *           and cheap: a wash is the least ink per square millimetre of colour
 *           on the sheet, which matters when this is printed at home.
 *   EDGE    the card's own frame, in the element. What you see of a card in a
 *           fanned hand is its edge, and nothing else on the face is visible.
 *   INK     the picture, in a DARKENED element (fire ink is red-800, not
 *           red-600). Darker than the old tint, so it gains contrast against
 *           the wash while still reading as its element.
 *
 * Net effect: much more colour, and the picture is more legible than it was,
 * not less. That is the whole trick, and it is why "add colour" did not have
 * to mean "make it busy".
 */
