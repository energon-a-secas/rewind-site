// The share viewer: it renders a resume that arrived in the URL fragment, and
// it does nothing else.
//
// The promise view.html makes to the reader is structural, and this file is
// where it could be broken. So: no fetch of the payload, no analytics (the page
// opts out of the fleet's counters in its head), and no replaceState, no form
// and no redirect that could move `#s=` into a query string, which is the only
// way a fragment ever reaches a server. "Make it yours" hands the tree to the
// builder through sessionStorage, same origin and same tab, then navigates to a
// URL that carries no fragment at all.
//
// It deliberately does not import state.js: this page never reads and never
// writes the visitor's own saved resumes. Contract C9.
