// Share links: the whole resume travels inside the URL fragment.
//
// Nothing is uploaded, and that is a property of the mechanism rather than a
// promise on a page. A fragment is not part of an HTTP request, so no server
// ever receives the payload. Two rules keep it true: this file never fetches
// and never moves the payload into a query string or a redirect, and view.html
// turns the fleet's analytics off, because a beacon carrying location.href
// would hand the document to a third party through the back door.
//
// Four primitives (toBase64Url, fromBase64Url, gzip, gunzip) are copied verbatim
// from projects/character-sheet-site/js/share/link.js:36-58, which is where they
// were proven. Nothing else from that file is reused: the rest of it encodes
// that game's own state.
//
// The payload is the canonical JSON tree, the same one toPlain() builds for the
// JSON export, gzipped and base64url'd. JSON rather than the YAML text:
// measured over the six library examples the two compress to within 4% of each
// other, and JSON lets view.html skip the js-yaml script and ship a tighter CSP.
//
// This module imports nothing. It takes a plain tree and returns strings, so it
// runs identically in the browser, in node and in a test.
