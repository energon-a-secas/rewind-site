"""Check (and fix) the card icons in assets/icons against one drawing standard.

Why this exists
---------------
The icons are rendered through `<img class="card-site-icon">` at a fixed 28x28.
That makes the *authored* stroke-width meaningless on its own: what the eye sees
is `stroke-width / viewBox-size * 28`. The set had been drawn on 15-, 20-, 24-,
36-, 48- and 64-unit canvases with stroke widths picked per icon, so effective
weight ran from 0.88px (64-unit canvas at stroke-width 2) to 2.33px (the
24-unit majority at stroke-width 2) — a 2.7x spread that read as "some of these
icons are faint" with no obvious cause.

The standard
------------
  stroke-width == viewBox-size / STROKE_DIVISOR      (one effective weight)
  stroke       == BRAND                              (never currentColor)
  linecap/linejoin == round                          (one corner language)
  no width/height attributes                         (CSS owns the box)

`currentColor` deserves its own note: it is the correct choice for an inlined
SVG and completely wrong here. An `<img>` loads the file as a separate document
with no access to the host page's colour, so `stroke="currentColor"` resolved to
black and those icons were rendering nearly invisible on a dark card.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/icon-lint.py            # report, exit 1 if anything is off
    python3 scripts/icon-lint.py --fix      # rewrite the offenders in place
