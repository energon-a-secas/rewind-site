/**
 * Badge art: pick a file, rasterise it here, then the three requests of C10.5.
 *
 * The shrink is not a nicety. Convex limits are per team and this team already
 * runs about twenty projects against 1 GB of storage and 1 GB a month of egress
 * shared with backups (C10.1), and every serve is also a function call. A 512
 * square PNG keeps a badge inside that budget.
 *
 * Round 2 (4.2): the picker also takes an SVG or a favicon. Both are drawn to
 * a canvas in this tab and re-encoded as PNG, so the deployment's contract
 * (C10.2, png, jpeg, webp) does not move and the file never leaves the tab as
 * SVG. An `<img>` fed a `blob:` URL of a local file runs no script and cannot
 * fetch (secure static mode), which is what makes the canvas the safe
 * rasteriser. A source of 64 pixels or under is drawn at the largest integer
 * multiple that fits, with smoothing off, so a 16 pixel icon becomes crisp
 * pixel art rather than blur; that is a look, not a lossless logo, and the
 * caption under the control says so.
 *
 * The stored value is a storage id, never a serving URL (C10.3): a URL goes
 * stale the moment the file is deleted and would bake a deployment hostname
 * into every saved design.
 *
 * The preview of a fresh attach is a `data:` URL, not a `blob:` one. The page's
 * CSP (C13.3, frozen) lets `img-src` draw a `blob:` and lets `connect-src`
 * fetch nothing of the kind, and the exporter's `inlineImages` fetches every
 * `<image href>` that is not already `data:`. A `blob:` preview therefore drew
 * and then broke every export until a reload swapped it for the storage URL
 * (round 2 verification, D1). Reading the PNG back through a FileReader costs
 * one pass over bytes already in memory and gives the preview, the thumbnail
 * and the export the same string, which the exporter passes through untouched.
