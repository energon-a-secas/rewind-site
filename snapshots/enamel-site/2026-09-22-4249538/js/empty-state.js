/**
 * The preset picker as the empty state (U1).
 *
 * The studio's own path is preset, then words, then publish, but a first visit
 * used to open on the default badge with fifty controls on the right and
 * Presets one of six same-weight buttons in the stage head. A visitor who does
 * not know twenty-eight finished designs exist starts editing the default. So
 * on a first visit the stage shows the presets of the current kind (sixteen
 * badges, twelve certificates) as
 * pictures, and choosing one paints it, opens Words and puts the cursor in the
 * first words field. A returning visitor lands on their draft as before; the
 * Presets button stays for later.
 *
 * Every thumbnail is drawn by the kit with the preview provenance, so the first
 * picture a visitor sees carries the strip (C11.1). Nothing here holds design
 * state: it shows or hides what the page already has.
